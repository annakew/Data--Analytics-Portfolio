A portfolio of statistical data analysis projects.

## [Predictors of Heart Disease Using A Logit Model](https://rpubs.com/annaew/939427)

Using data from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Heart Disease Data Set available at UCI Machine Learning Repository, I demonstrate the application of logit models in predicting the probability of heart disease.

## [Are Cryptocurrencies a Poor Store of Value?](https://rpubs.com/annaew/939436)

These markets are at an early stage of development, and as such suffer from issues of credibility, sustainability and regulation which cause them to be typically more volatile than traditional fiat money. The aim of this project is to forecast the volatility and price level cryptocurrencies.

## [The Effect of Reducing Costly Waiting Times on Demand for NHS Services](https://github.com/annakew/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/The_Effect_of_Reducing_Costly_Waiting_Times_on_Demand_for_NHS_Services__Copy_.pdf)

Can excessive NHS waiting times be reduced without significantly stimulating demand? I employ a Two Stage Least Squares approach to model demand utilisation for NHS elective care with respect to waiting times.

## [Modelling The Effect of High Frequency Latency-Arbitrage Strategies on Bid-Ask Spreads](https://github.com/annakew/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Bid%20Ask%20Spreads.pdf)

Are latency-arbitrage trading strategies harmful to markets? I conduct an investigation into the effect of latency-arbitrage algorithmic trading strategies (LAS), which exploit geographically fragmented markets, on effective bid-offer spreads in the SPDR S\&P 500 trust exchange-traded fund (SPY ETF) market for the year 2019. A two stage least squares approach is employed to establish a causal relationship between an exogenous increase in LAS strategies and effective bid-ask spreads, via changes to the market data transmissions network that connects trading venues to trading firms in Secaucus, Mahwah and Carteret, in the United States.

## [Forecasting U.S. Recession](https://github.com/annakew/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Forecasting%20US%20Recession.pdf)

Economic turning points are notoriously hard to predict. A probit model was applied to monthly macroeconomic and other data from The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to forecast U.S. recession.
